# Officer Information API

## Overview

The Officer Information API is designed to retrieve officer information for various student organizations. The API utilizes a Python script for web scraping to collect officer details from a specified website.

## Getting Started

To use the Officer Information API, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `urllib`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the Python script to scrape and organize links:

   ```bash
   python organize_links_script.py
   ```

   This script will generate a file named `organized_links.json` containing organized links.

2. Host the Python script on a server or cloud platform.

3. Set up the web UI by creating an HTML file and including the provided JavaScript and CSS files.

4. Update the JavaScript file (`script.js`) with the correct endpoint for your hosted Python script.

5. Open the HTML file in a web browser and use the UI to input organization names and fetch officer information.

## API Endpoints

- **Endpoint**: `/your-python-script-endpoint`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**:
  - `organization`: The name of the organization for which officer information is requested.

Example:

```bash
curl http://your-api-domain/your-python-script-endpoint?organization=example_organization
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that Python and the required libraries are correctly installed.
- Check the console or log for any error messages during script execution.
